Now a days almost all the organizations started to adopt to the cloud native tools and services to deal with their data and make decisions based up on the out come from the data analysis made upon data warehouses to improve their operational capacity and services. In situations where companies need to handle the vast amount of data which is stored in servers, companies tend to rely on various tools such PowerBI, Tableau, DataFactory etc.. to analyse the data and visualize to grow their business in the form of trends, graphs, charts and more. This kind of visualization and representation of data can help and boost companies chances to steadily grow in the IT world.Â 

During the research about big data I learned that there are few services such as Azure CosmosDB which stores data through different APIs and uses Kusto as the query language to get the visualizations and trends of the data which can be integrated to tools such as PowerBI to send reports.
