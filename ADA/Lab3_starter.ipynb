    "The National Snow and Ice Data Center (https://nsidc.org/) maintains a lot of information about snow and ice.  One of their datasets concerns \"sea ice,\" that is, ice which is floating on some ocean or other seawater body.  Almost all of this is either in the Arctic or Antarctic regions and, as you can imagine, the extent of the ice changes over the course of each year.  It's also changing in longer timeframes and this has attracted quite a lot of attention from climate scientists.  We're going to look at some data on the extent of Arctic ice.  There's a nifty tool for visualizing the data we're going to look at here: https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/charctic-interactive-sea-ice-graph/\n",
